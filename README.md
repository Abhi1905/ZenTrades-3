Project 3 Submission: Frontend Login Dashboard

Work Done: The login page is made.

Points taken care of:
1. The user name field only accept an email format and the validation is done through Javascript.
2. The password field is a masked field i.e. it does not reveals what the user is entering.
3. The password field does not accepts any special character other than '@' and only gets accepted when it contains an uppercase letter and a number.

Whenever any incorrect email is entered,an alert is shown !

Email is only accepted if it is in the valid format i.e. it must contain one '@' and one '.' indicating an email being valid.

Whenever any incorrect password is entered,an alert is shown !

In the end when email and password both are entered in correct format an alert showing 'Login Succesful!' displays. 

At last the project is hosted on Github pages. Please do give it a try. ðŸ˜Š
